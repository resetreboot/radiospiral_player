    Ditched mplayer as the stream decoding + audio play, it is ancient and abandoned

    Now using ffmpeg as the stream decoding backend

    Now we use the oto player library to control the playback and get the raw WAV
        stream to the OS audio system

    Fixed the GUI for the play button

    Added mute button to the GUI
