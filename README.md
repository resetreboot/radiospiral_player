# RadioSpiral Player for GNU/Linux

This is the official native GNU/Linux application to listen to RadioSpiral and keep informed
about the upcoming shows. Self contained app, just requiring having MPlayer installed on the 
system.

It uses Flyte as the GUI and MPlayer as the backend to stream from the radio.

## Installation

Just put it in your path or copy to `$HOME/.local/bin` (ensure that it is in your path!).

## Running

Launch the application and press play, that's all. You can pause the stream and control the
volume with the buttons provided for that and the application will update itself to show you
what's playing and the next live show for the radio.
